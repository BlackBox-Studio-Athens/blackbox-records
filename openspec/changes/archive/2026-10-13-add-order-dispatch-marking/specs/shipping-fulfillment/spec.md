## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: BOX NOW data minimization

The system MUST avoid persisting raw BOX NOW widget, API, credential, voucher, label, tracking automation, or portal payloads in v1.

#### Scenario: Paid Greek order needs fulfillment

- **GIVEN** a paid Greek order exists
- **WHEN** operators create a BOX NOW shipment manually
- **THEN** the repo stores only Worker-owned order/payment and approved minimal shipping-mode data needed for handoff
- **AND** the staff dispatch mark stores only whether the order is shipped, when it last changed and which operator changed it.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Shell navigation loading remains apparent

The app shell SHALL keep same-document route transitions visibly apparent while preserving focus and scroll behavior.

#### Scenario: Shell section navigation is in flight

- **GIVEN** a shopper follows a shell-managed header, footer, or mobile-nav section link
- **WHEN** the shell is fetching and applying the next page snapshot
- **THEN** the route loading indicator and section transition communicate that navigation is in progress
- **AND** the final state still resets scroll, moves focus to `main[data-app-shell-main]`, and does not leave a stale busy indicator open.

### Requirement: Overlay loading is visible and accessible

The app shell SHALL show an accessible overlay loading state while partial detail content is being fetched.

#### Scenario: Overlay content is loading

- **GIVEN** a shell-managed artist, release, or news detail link opens an overlay
- **WHEN** the partial overlay HTML is not yet available
- **THEN** the overlay panel reserves stable space and shows a visible loading status
- **AND** the loading status uses `role="status"` or equivalent polite live semantics
- **AND** close behavior and focus management remain available.

### Requirement: Player embed loading is visible and calm

The player surface SHALL make third-party iframe loading visible without implying playback has started.

#### Scenario: Embedded player iframe is loading

- **GIVEN** the user starts a Bandcamp or Tidal player session
- **WHEN** the iframe is mounted but has not reported loaded state
- **THEN** the modal displays a visible embed loading state with spinner or equivalent loading affordance
- **AND** the modal exposes busy state accessibly
- **AND** the loading copy does not imply audio playback is active before iframe interaction.

### Requirement: Shell loading motion respects reduced motion

The app shell SHALL keep loading and transition motion compatible with reduced-motion preferences.

#### Scenario: Reduced motion is requested

- **WHEN** the browser reports a reduced-motion preference
- **THEN** route, overlay, and player loading indicators avoid nonessential sweeping, pulsing, or animated placeholder motion
- **AND** visible status text remains available.
